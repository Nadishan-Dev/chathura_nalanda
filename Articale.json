When you give your subscribers real value, they’ll keep coming back to you for all of their hotel needs. Emails remain in recipients’ inboxes for a very long time (or until they are removed), in contrast to Instagram stories or posts, which appear in the feed for a day before disappearing into the sea of other postings. They can then be quickly passed along to others or even referred to again if necessary.</li><br></br>",

Email marketing is the way to go in this regard if hotels want to use their marketing dollars wisely.</li></br>"
